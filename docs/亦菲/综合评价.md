## 业内评价

### 某电影助理导演

> 一个业内朋友发来信息说：
> “梦华录，好看！ 目前8集看，各方面都是比较平均的好，只要后期剧情不拉夸，刘仙女稳提一个年度热播高口碑剧[鼓掌][鼓掌]”

> “这个剧绝对好，嗯，绝对成绩会好的。我因为今年比较闲，所以其实上半年还看了挺多剧的，我可以不夸张的说，迄今为止，22年迄今为止古装剧最佳吧，肯定是。”

> “看得出来，表演有很多细腻的处理，还有原声台词，都很加分。”

> “我是开着弹幕看的，观众也不瞎不聋，这些好也都看得到。”

> “感受到她作为演员全方位的好。”

> “这个是真的好，她会因这个角色作品拿到好成绩的。”

> “好作品就该夸，业内人士更不该吝啬给同行打气[偷笑]”

> 我说：“同意。”


## 观众评价

完整看过剧的观众的反馈相对来说更加直接和客观一些,言之有物，不容易流于空泛和刻板印象。

## 海外评价

节选了部分在`YOUTUBE`平台上的对刘亦菲在剧中表现的高赞评论:

> Love this drama and Liu Yifei! She’s an amazing actress! This drama is based on an ancient Chinese story/drama/play from Guan Hanqing that depicts the struggle of women (the script of “A Dream of Splendor “ is original), especially the life of women that worked in the music/performance industry at that time. This drama not only has beautiful love story but also the mutual help among women. It also contains a lot of beautiful Chinese cultural elements.


> Waiting for episode 7… this drama is sooo good so far. Main leads are impressive. Female lead she’s so beautiful, elegant and I love her voice so much! Loving the supporting actors too

> Female lead role is better than most nowadays. She's not skilled in martial arts but have natural life skills and isn't childish. She is relatable, calm, down to earth, and simple. So far so good and an interesting drama...

> While others keep altering their natural beauty, Crystal Liu has proven time again every time she appears on screen, She is undoubtedly and incredibly the most beautiful Chinese actress I have ever seen. Her nose makes her stand out which most actresses would rush to alter in a heart beat. Something about her screams ethereal and Goddess like looks puts her in a class of her own. How can she look so beautiful without even changing after her debut drama in 2006???

> This series is interesting. There's a hidden plot and we don't know what it is yet. The casts are good at acting. And the chemistry between the 2 main leads is so amazing. Can't wait to see more episodes.

> I really like this drama so far and all the characters are also good...I am happy to find this drama where the lead actress is not portrayed as a dumb and foolish girl. FL has done awesome job
